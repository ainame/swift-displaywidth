A portable/cross-platform implementation of `wcwidth(3)` with up-to-date Unicode spec.
This project has own Unicode data tables generated from following files.

* https://unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt
* https://unicode.org/Public/17.0.0/ucd/EastAsianWidth.txt

## Why use this?

Instead of this library, there's `wcwidth` imported with `import Darwin`, `import Musl`, or `import Glibc`.

- https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/wcwidth.3.html
- https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/wcwidth.html
- https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/ctype/wcwidth.c

If that meets your requirements, you should just use it. However, this project has following superior points.

- Portable/Cross-platform implementation that doesn't require a C library nor even Foundation
- Up-to-date Unicode spec
- Better support of Unicode grapheme clusters
- Swift-friendly API

## Usage

Add to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ainame/swift-displaywidth", from: "0.0.3")
]
```

Then:

```swift
import DisplayWidth

// call as function
let displayWidth = DisplayWidth()
displayWidth("A")        // 1
displayWidth("„ÅÇ")       // 2
displayWidth("üë©‚Äçüíª")       // 2
displayWidth("e\u{0301}") // 1 (e + combining acute)

// If your environment treat ambiguous chars as full-width,
// you can set this option.
let displayWidth = DisplayWidth(treatAmbiguousAsFullWidth: true)
```
